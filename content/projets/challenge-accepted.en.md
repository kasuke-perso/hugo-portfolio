Project from school (Semester 4) proposed by Eric Lalitte :

The main goal was to provide an network infrastructure for students to make them practice the networks courses from OpenClassroom, automatically, from the creation, validation, to destruction.

Depending on the lesson, we wanted to create a server or an infrastructure already configured, we provide every credentials the student need to access the course.

So, to create the machines/infrastructures we used Terraform + AWS and for provisionning we used Ansible

The project look like exactly like this website -> https://labex.io/

But back in the day, we didn't know about this website neither about theses solutions which are AWS, Terraform and Ansible. This was a real challenge for me because it was the first time I was Team leader, but thankfully we were only 2 so it was pretty simple to manage.
